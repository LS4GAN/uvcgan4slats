# Unpaired Image Translation with UVCGAN on the Simple Liquid Argon Track Samples (SLATS) dataset

**Description:**

## Download SLATS data and pre-trained models
- Download pretrained [translator models](https://zenodo.org/deposit/7809460#) from Zenodo
- Download the [SLATS dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/7809108#.ZDQ9AHbMK3A) from Zenodo

## Run inference with pretrained translator models

## Train your own model
In this part, we demonstrate how to try your own model using training on SLATS as an example. 

### Pretraining (optional but recommended)
- pretraining configuration: 
- pretraining command:

### Training:
- training configuration:
  - with pretrained generators:
  - from scratch:
