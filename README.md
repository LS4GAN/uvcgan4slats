# Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation of the `SLATS` dataset with `UVCGAN`

This repository demonstrates application of the unpaired image-to-image 
translation method `UVCGAN` ([Paper][uvcgan_paper], [repo][uvcgan_repo]) 
to the domain translation problem, common in science.

This README file has two main parts. In the first 
[part](#neutrino-detector-response-translation), we describe how to 
apply `UVCGAN` to the translation of a LArTPC detector response, following 
the [`UVCGAN4SLATS` paper][uvcgan_paper]: _Unsupervised Domain Transfer 
for Science: Exploring Deep Learning Methods for Translation between LArTPC 
Detector Simulations with Differing Response Models_.

In the second [part](#train-your-own-model), we provide a tutorial on how 
to apply `UVCGAN` to any domain translation problem. This part should serve 
as a guide on who to apply `UVCGAN` to your work. Please don't hesitate to 
contact us if you encounter any challenges in the process.

## :tada::tada:Anoucements:tada::tada:
We have released a new and improved version of `UVCGAN` -- 
[`UVCGANv2`][uvcgan2_repo] -- that delivers outstanding results on 
photographic datasets (CelebA-HQ and AFHQ).

You don't want to miss out on this upgrade, so go ahead and check it out!

# Installation and requirements

## Requirements

`uvcgan4slats` models were trained under the official `PyTorch` container
`pytorch/pytorch:1.12.1-cuda11.3-cudnn8-runtime`. A similar training
environment can be created by running the following command from the
`uvcgan4slats` source folder.
```
conda env create -f contrib/conda_env.yml
```
Later on, the environment can be activated by running
```
conda activate uvcgan4slats
```

## Installation

To install the `uvcgan4slats` package, run the following command from the
`uvcgan4slats` source folder.
```
python setup.py develop --user
```

## Dependencies

The working of `uvcgan4slats` dependes on the `toytools` package. Download and
install the package by running the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/LS4GAN/toytools
cd toytools
python setup.py develop --user
```
(the last command must be run in the `uvcgan4slats` conda environment)

## Environment Setup

`uvcgan4slats` uses extensively two environment variables: `UVCGAN_DATA` to
locate dataset and `UVCGAN_OUTDIR` to save output. Users are advised to set
these environment variables. `uvcgan4slats` will look for datasets in the
`${UVCGAN_DATA}` directory and will save results under the `${UVCGAN_OUTDIR}`
directory. If these variables are not set, they will default to `./data` and
`./outdir`, respectively. To set up the environment variables, run the
following commands
```
export UVCGAN_DATA=PATH_TO_DATASET
export UVCGAN_OUTDIR=PATH_TO_OUTDIR
```

# Neutrino Detector Response Translation

## The `SLATS` Dataset
The Simple Liquid Argon Track Samples (`SLATS`) dataset was created from 
simulated neutrino events in a Liquid Argon Time-Projection Chamber (LArTPC) 
detector. The dataset contains two domains of events, each corresponding a 
specific detector response function.

The unpaired image-to-image translation method `UVCGAN` is used to find two 
mappings `G_ab` and `G_ba`. These mapping can take a neutrino event from one 
domain, modify its detector response, and make it look like a neutrino event 
from the other domain.

The training of the `G_ab` and `G_ba` mappings is performed in a fully 
unsupervised (unpaired) way. But, to facilitate the evaluation of the quality 
of domain translation, the `SLATS` dataset also contains explicit pairing 
between the events of the two domains.

In this section, we describe how to download the SLATS dataset, and how to use 
`UVCGAN` to perform its domain translation.

## Download `SLATS` and pre-trained models
The [datasets](https://zenodo.org/record/7809108) and pretrained
[models](https://zenodo.org/record/7853835) can be downloaded directly from
the Zenodo website, or use the downloading scripts:
- **datasets**:
  - `SLATS` tiles (256 x 256 images):
  ```
  ./scripts/download_slats_datasets.sh tiles
  ```
  - `SLATS` center crops (768 x 5888 images):
  ```
  ./scripts/download_slats_datasets.sh center_crops
  ```
  The datasets will be saved at
  `${UVCGAN_DATA}/slats/slats_[tiles,center_crops]` or
  `./data/slats/slats_[tiles,center_crops]` if `UVCGAN_DATA` is unset.

  Note that the `SLATS` center crops are not used for training `UVCGAN`. We
  provide the dataset so you can try developing more efficient and powerful
  networks for much larger images :wink:
- **models**:
  To download trained models on `SLATS`, run
  ```
  ./scripts/download_slats_models.sh
  ```
  The files will be saved at `${UVCGAN_OUTDIR}/slats/pretrained` or
  `./outdir/slats/pretrained` if `UVCGAN_OUTDIR` is unset.

# Run inference with pre-trained translators
To run inference with pre-trained translators, run the following command in
the `uvcgan4slats` source folder
```
python scripts/translate_data.py PATH_TO_PRETRAINED_MODELS
```
If the pretrained models are downloaded using the downloading script,
`PATH_TO_PRETRAINED_MODELS` here is either
`${UVCGAN_OUTDIR}/slats/pretrained` or `./outdir/slats/pretrained` if
`UVCGAN_OUTDIR` is unset.

The results are saved to
`PATH_TO_PRETRAINED_MODELS/evals/final/ndarrays_eval-test`. In it are six
subfolders:
- `fake_a` and `fake_b`: translated images.
  More precisely, let `G_ab` be the translator from domain `a` to domain `b`
  and let `x` be an image from domain `a`, then `G_ab(x)` will be found in
  `fake_b`.
- `real_a` and `real_b`: true images from their respective domains.
- `reco_a` and `reco_b`: cyclically reconstructed images.
  More precisely, let `G_ba` be the translator from domain `b` to domain `a`,
  then `G_ba(G_ab(x))` will be found in `reco_a`.

We can use `./scripts/plot_comparisons.py` to compare pairs of images. Denote
the result folder by `RESULT`, then we can run the following command to
generate 20 plots comparing translations to the targets. The resulting plots
will be saved to the folder `./comp_images`.
```
python ./scripts/plot_comparisons.py RESULT/fake_b RESULT/real_b \
  ./comp_images -n 20 --log --symmetric
```
We use `--log` here to plot in log or symlog scale and use `--symmetric` to
indicate that the values are symmetric around zero. We need those two
parameters for `SLATS` images, but it may not be case for other grayscale
images.
Here are three samples produced by `./scripts/plot_comparisons.py` comparing
the `UVCGAN` translation (on left) to the target (on right).

# Train your own model
In this part, we demonstrate how to train `UVCGAN` model on your own dataset. 
We will discuss three topics: Prepare the dataset, Pre-train the generators 
(optional), and Train I2I translation.

For the generator pre-training and image-to-image translation training, we 
will use `SLATS` scripts as examples:
```
scripts/slats/pretrain_slats-256.py
scripts/slats/train_slats-256.py
```
We recommend the following approach when adapting UVCGAN to you needs. Start 
with one of the provided example scripts. Make minimal modifications to make it 
work for your problem. Once it is working -- further customize the model 
configuration to achieve the best results.

## 0. Dataset
Please organized your dataset as follows:
```bash
PATH/TO/YOUR/DATASET
├── train
│   ├── DOMAIN_A
│   └── DOMAIN_B
└── test
    ├── DOMAIN_A
    └── DOMAIN_B
```
where `PATH/TO/YOUR/DATASET` is the [dataset location][dataset_location] and
`DOMAIN_A` and `DOMAIN_B` are the [domain names][domain_names].

To make the training scripts, `pretrain_slats-256.py` and 
`train_slats-256.py`, work with your dataset, they will 
require minimal modifications. In essense, each script contains a python 
dictionary describing the training configuration. You would need to 
modify the data section of that dictionary to make it work with your dataset.
The exact modification will depend on the format of your dataset.

### 0.1 Natural images
  This repository is primarily focused on scientific datasets. If your dataset 
  is made of natural images in common formats (`jepg`, `png`, `webp`, 
  [etc.][image_ext]), you may find it more useful to take one of the 
  [`UVCGAN`][uvcgan_repo] or [`UVCGANv2`][uvcgan2_repo] training scripts as a 
  staring point.
  
  To make those scripts work with your dataset, simply modify the path parameter 
  of the data configuration. The path should to point to the location of your 
  dataset on a disk.
### 0.2 Compressed `NumPy` arrays (saved with extension `*.npz`)
  We provide two examples of the data configurations that support the loading of 
  `npz` arrays:
  1. Plain loading of `NumPy` arrays. The script [`dataloading.py`][dataloading] 
  demonstrates data configuration, suitable for loading of the `NumPy` arrays. 
  This script loads data samples from the `SLATS` dataset.
  1. Loading `NumPy` and performing additional transformations. The script 
  [`dataloading_transform.py`][dataloading_transform] shows an example of the data 
  configuration, supporting user-defined transformations. This script is adapted 
  from the [BRaTS 2021 Task 1 dataset][MRI_dataset].
  1. Customized dataset. If you are working with a custom dataset that does not 
  fall into the previous two categories, you will need to implememt your own 
  `PyTorch` dataset and place it to 
  [`./uvcgan/data/datasets`](./uvcgan/data/datasets). Then, modify the 
  `select_dataset` function of [`./uvcgan/data/data.py`](./uvcgan/data/data.py) to 
  support the usage of the custom dataset.

## 1. Pretraining (optional but recommended)
Unpaired image-to-image translation presents a significant challenge. As such,
it may be advantageous to start the training with prepared networks, rather
than randomly initialized ones. And the advantange of pre-training is
confirmed by multiple works (see section 5.3 of the
[`UVCGAN` paper][uvcgan_paper] for more
information). 

There are a number of ways for pre-training. Here for `SLATS`,
we use the BERT-like pretraining approach. We subdivide each image into a grid
of 32 x 32 blocks and randomly replace the all values in 40% of the blocks
with zero. Then, we train a generator to fill in the blanks on the two domains
jointly. This generator is then used to initialize both generators for the
translation training. For more detail of pre-training on `SLATS`, see section
3.3.1 of the [`UVCGAN4SLATS` paper][uvcgan4slats_paper].

The script [`pretrain_slats-256.py`](./scripts/slats/pretrain_slats-256.py) 
can be used for `SLATS` pre-training. If you need to adapt this script for 
your own dataset, consider the modification of the following configuration 
options:
- data configuration, or just dataset location and domain names for simpler 
cases.
- `label`
- `outdir`.

The pre-training script can be run as:
```
python ./script/slats/pretrain_slats-256.py
```
The type of the generator and batch size can be configured using command-line 
flags `--gen` and `--batch_size`, respectively. All the other parameters (e.g. 
generator/discriminator, optimizer, scheduler, masking, etc.) can be modified 
directly in the script.

## 2. Training

Similar to the pre-training, you can initiate the SLATS I2I translation training
with the script [`train_slats-256.py`](./script/slats/train_slats-256.py).

Likewise, to modify this script for your own dataset, change the following 
configuration options:
- data configuration, or just dataset location and domain names, for simpler cases.
- `label`
- `outdir`
- `transfer`. The `transfer` configuration specifies how to load the pre-trained 
generators. If you chose not to do the pre-training, set this option to None. 
Otherwise, modify the path to the pre-trained model.

The I2I training can be started with:
```
python ./script/slats/train_slats-256.py
```

### 2.1 Key hyper-parameters for optimal performance
Please consider tuning the following parameters for better result:
1. **cycle-consistency loss coefficient `--lambda-cycle`**:
  Equal to $\lambda_{\textrm{cyc}}$ in section 3.1 of the
  [`UVCGAN` paper][uvcgan_paper], and $\lambda_{a}$ and $\lambda_{b}$ in
  section 3.3.2 of the [`UVCGAN4SLATS` paper][uvcgan4slats_paper].
1. **learning rates `--lr-gen` and `--lr-disc`**:
  See dicussion in section 3.3.2 of the
  [`UVCGAN4SLATS` paper][uvcgan4slats_paper].
1. **discriminator gradient penalty `--gp-constant` and `--gp-lambda`**:
  In section 3.3 of the [`UVCGAN` paper][uvcgan_paper] and section 3.3.2 of
  the [`UVCGAN4SLATS` paper][uvcgan4slats_paper], we have `gp-constant`
  $=\gamma$ and `gp-lambda` $=\lambda_{\textrm{GP}}$.
